# Sales Advice from the Experts

{{< image src="../../images/blog/sales/2022-09-04-sales-advice-from-the-experts.jpg" alt="Dressing up for a client meeting" set="fit" >}}

Over the years, so many people have been valuable mentors for me in sales. I wanted to share my summary of their words of wisdom to hopefully help others who are on a similar path.

- Chris P. = Avoid the traps.

    - No product or service is perfect. Identify their weak points, avoid them, and be prepared with answers if the client asks about them.

- Colin M. = Sell your product without ever saying the technology name behind it.

    - For example, I sell Tanzu which is a collection of cloud-native technologies that revolve around Kubernetes. If I can sell Tanzu without ever saying the word "Kubernetes" then that's a success. The underlying technology shouldn't matter. The solution does.

-  David C. = Start with why.

    - People, and especially executives, hate to waste their time. When starting a presentation, explain the problem you're trying to solve and why it matters.

-  Drew H. = People crave stories.

    - Stories are memorable and keep people engaged. Start the presentation off with a story and tie it back in during the middle and end.

-  Joe R. = Less is more.

    - Don't overload your audience with a million and one bullet points. Keep each slide in your deck short and sweet.

-  Mark C. = People buy from people they like.

    - Building relationships is so important. Customers aren't just clients. They should be friends of yours. Friends are more open to what you have to say and take your opinion into account.

-  Michael F. = It's not a presentation, it's a conversation.

    - Remember those short and sweet slides? Focus on discovery and engaging with your client and less on reading off from a slide deck.

-  Mike E. = Make sure you can live off of your base salary.

    - For better or worse, many sales roles are commission-based. Ensure that you can pay your monthly bills even if your team has made no sales.

-  Trent G. = Use a different tone based on the audience.

    - Executives expect a more serious tone. With IT teams, they are generally more laid back and enjoy more enthusiastic conversations.

-  Will A. = Solve real client problems.

    - Sales, ironically, isn't about selling. It's about identifying problems and providing solutions to them. That's how you get a sale.
