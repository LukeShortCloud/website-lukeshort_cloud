S.M.A.R.T. is an acronym that will help you make the best pitch possible when talking to stakeholders (potetional or existing). Here's what it stands for:

**S**pecific, **M**easurable, **A**ttainable, **R**elevant, and **T**ime-based.

- **SPECIFIC**. Set focused goals for the presentation. Address why you are there and what value you are trying to add. Communicate to your audience what those goals are at both the beginning and the end of the presentation.

- **MEASURABLE**. How do you know if the goal has been met? Clearly define something such as “after *X* amount of time, *Y* should be delivered and lead to *Z* amount of cost savings.”

- **ATTAINABLE**. Avoid impossible tasks and be reasonable in what can be done while considering constraints such as budget, time, and other resources. The objective is ultimately to deliver a good and realistic solution. Over-promising often leads to under-delivering.

- **RELEVANT**. Every goal needs to be relevant to the stakeholder and their market. Do your research before the presentation to understand the competition (both the stakeholder's and your own) and where your product fits in.

- **TIME-BASED**. To quote Anthony Robbins, “if you talk about it, it's a dream, if you envision it, it's possible, but if you schedule it, it's real.” Make it real and schedule it! Use your best judgement and experience to figure out a projected timeline. A good tip is to take your instinctual best guest and then multiply by 2 to 3. There will always be unforeseen slowdowns and complications. Plus, if all goes smoothly, under-promising and over-delivering will delight your stakeholder.

If you address each of these often overlooked topics, then you are sure to have a stellar foundation for your presentation!
