# Speaking Their Language

Want to come off as relatable to potential stakeholders and earn their trust? Start by speaking their language.

Everyone has their own set of go-to phrases, terms, and acronyms. The key is to listen, and I mean *really* listen. Chris Voss, author of *Never Split the Difference*, had something so simple yet so impactful to say regarding this: “listening is not a passive activity. It is the most active thing you can do.” Put aside your desire to keep talking up your *amazing* product every second. Sales conversations are not about you and your product. It is about *them*, the potential stakeholders, and their needs.

Recently, I was working with a stakeholder to help secure a solid long-term relationship with them. During my first call with them, I took note of different keywords they kept saying. “Labor day sale," “UAT (user-assurance testing) environment," “SOX audit," “platform engineers," etc. At first glance, these all may seem like normal words, but they are more important than that. On the next call, I was prepared to mirror their terminology.

“We are here to help prepare you for the Labor Day sale. Our focus is on working closely with the Platform Engineers to address SOX audit requirements for the UAT environment.”

This is a much more tailored message compared to:

“We are here to help you with the upcoming sale. Our focus is working with your team on setting up a new environment that meets security requirements.”

This technique is subtle and makes a real difference. It builds a subconscious connection with any partners you are working with. They are more willing to keep the conversation going, reveal more useful information to help set up all parties for success, and they will have more confidence in you. Try it out for yourself next time you are in a meeting!
