# Dealing with Disastrous Demos

Demos, demos, demos. Working with potential stakeholders means showcasing your products and proof-of-concepts. Sometimes it feels like everything revolves around the demonstration. Now what if things go south? And I mean *really* south.

Let's take a step back to talk about demos and how we can avoid some common pitfalls.

**De-emphasize the demo.** This is a very important concept I learned from the book *Mastering Technical Sales* by John Care and Chris Daly. Don't keep telling your stakeholders that all of their problems will be addressed in the upcoming demo. Imagine if you did and the demo failed horribly. They'll feel as though the product does *not* solve their problems and instead is full of new issues!

**Keep it simple. Keep it focused.** You do not have to show everything and the kitchen sink. Hone in on what the audience is there for. Do they not care about authentication? Great! Skip it. Do they want to see more automation? Keep the conversation focused on that.

***Uh oh. The demo's on fire (and not in a good way). This is fine. No, really, it is. Stay calm and listen up.***

**Don't focus on the demo failures. Push the presentation forward.** It is common to draw even more attention to an issue by pointing it out and talking about it. Acknowledge that there was an issue, shut up about it, and then move on. If you force yourself to forget it happened so will your audience.

**Team work makes the dream work.** Coordinate with your team to set up hand signals or a back-end group chat. That way, you can alert your team when you feel that you need help. Then they can swoop in to help save the day.

**Have a backup plan prepared.** Live demo didn't work? Go figure! It is Murphyâ€™s Law in full effect. Good thing you came prepared with a pre-recorded demo and backup slides! Have something else prepared in your back pocket that can be pulled out at a moment's notice.

These are a few tips I use on a daily basis. Hopefully this'll help prepare you for those demos that almost end up in a worst case scenario! *Preparation is everything.*
