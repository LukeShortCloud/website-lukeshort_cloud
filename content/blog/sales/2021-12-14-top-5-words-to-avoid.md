Many words have the power to trigger specific emotional responses. During a sales pitch to a client, this is incredibly important to keep top-of-mind. Based on both experience and research, here are my top five words to avoid, along with their related synonyms and alternative phrases.

- **Buyer (or customer)**
    - These words indicate that you're only interested in making money and that you don’t care about them as an individual.
    - Alternative: "**potential stakeholder**" for a new customer or "**stakeholder**" for an existing customer.

- **Competitor (or rival)**
    - These are phrases you use around co-workers, not stakeholders. These words signal to your potential stakeholders that the conversation is not about you and them, but rather that it’s about wanting to beat out others in the market.
    - Alternative: "**alternative solutions**."

- **Maybe (hopefully, probably, or sort of)**
    - These words do not spark confidence. Give firm answers whenever possible to build an image of certainty and reliability.
    - Alternative: "**yes**," "**no**," or "**definitely**."

- **Contract (deal or opportunity)**
    - This takes them out of the experience and, again, makes them feel like you selfishly want to hit your sales quota.
    - Alternative: "**partnership**" or "**relationship**."

- **Problem (objection, issue, or pain)**
    - The words that should be avoided typically invoke negative thoughts. You want to keep the tone positive. On the contrary, a "challenge" indicates that there is something that can be overcome (with the help of your products and/or services).
    - Alternative: "**challenge**."

Next time you’re practicing your sales pitch, have someone listen to you or record yourself and watch it back. Ask for feedback on the words you are saying and tweak them if necessary. If you remember these tips, they will help you with your next potential stakeholder call. Becoming an excellent salesperson is a never-ending journey of learning and discovery with opportunities for growth at every step.
