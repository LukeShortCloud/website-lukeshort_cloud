# Learn Rust in 30 Days

{{< image src="../../images/blog/linux/2023-05-01-rust-30-days.jpg" alt="Rusty steel support beam" set="fit" >}}

## Introduction

Imagine a world full of peace and prosperity. A utopia of sorts. A place like Japan where you've never felt safer. A location where no security guards are required. This, my friends, is the world of the Rust programming language.

In all seriousness, Rust is a lot of fun to learn but comes with its own pros and cons like any language. For one thing, writing code takes longer and requires more lines than compared to Python. However, I believe the benefits outweight the negatives. More on that later. I'm here to share my personal experiences to help give you guidance. This is information I wish I had many years ago.

Why learn Rust specifically? [It's faster, more energy efficient, and more secure than C++](https://rootpages.lukeshort.cloud/latest/programming/rust.html#introduction). In a world where memory exploits (a non-issue in Rust) account for up to [90% of known vulnerabilities in Android](https://security.googleblog.com/2019/05/queue-hardening-enhancements.html), security matters big time. The kernels for both [Linux](https://thenewstack.io/rust-in-the-linux-kernel/) and [Windows](https://www.neowin.net/news/senior-microsoft-exec-says-windows-11-kernel-will-soon-be-booting-with-rust-inside/) are also starting to transition over to using Rust. Even [graphics drivers](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Rust-DRM-AGX-RFC-Preview) are being made in Rust these days! This seems to be just the start of the next generation of programming.

## Getting Started

Most people ask me where to even start when learning a programming language. I came up with my own [guide](https://rootpages.lukeshort.cloud/programming/devops.html#learning-a-new-programming-language) that lists out the most important topics in the order they should be learned. This was a great starting point. As for how to learn Rust specifically? The first thing I did was collect a list of useful resources to study from [here](https://rootpages.lukeshort.cloud/latest/programming/rust.html#tutorials). Most folks will point you to ["The [Rust] Book"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), which is great. I have found that having a diverse set of study material is helpful.

30 days ago I started to learn Rust every day. There were a few "cheat days" where I didn't do any programming but I made sure to always read up on new topics and start to understand some of the more complex subjects. As I once learned, it is better to study thirty minutes every day than one hour five days a week. If you can somehow tie this into work, it makes it even easier to do every day.

Try working on your own program from scratch. [Here](https://github.com/the-programmers-hangout/programming-resources/blob/master/ideas.md) are some good beginner project ideas if you need some. At one point, I decieded to temporarily ignore the guides I was following and instead just work on a project to see what gaps there were in my knowledge. (Spoiler: there were a lot of gaps). So I decieded to work on my light show project: [Make It Jingle (MIJ)](https://github.com/LukeShortCloud/mij). This led me down a fun and very useful rabbit hole for a few days.

- Day 1: How do I install an external YAML library?
    - Day 2: How do I read from a file?
        - Day 3: How do I use a struct data type to define the layout of a YAML file?
            - Day 4: How do I parse YAML?

## End of an Era

At the end of 30 days, where was I at? Around 1,400 lines of notes consisting of 5,000 words. All of my Rust notes are open source [here](https://rootpages.lukeshort.cloud/latest/programming/rust.html) as part of my [Root Pages](https://github.com/LukeShortCloud/rootpages) project. I'll always continue to update and add Rust notes there as long as I continue to use the language (which may be forever, who knows!).

## Where to Next?

Looking forward towards the future, these are my personal next steps. After 30 days, I feel this is the perfect opportunity to branch out away from textbooks and standard reading material. The journey isn't over. In fact, it has just begun!

- [Exercism](https://exercism.org/) = This is the best site to become an expert in any programming language. It is free and you are assigned human mentors to assess and review your code.
- [uutils coreutils](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) = Many projects, such as this one, have a "good first issue" label attached to bug and feature requests. I have a personal interest in this project as I want to use it for my operating system I built: [winesapOS](https://github.com/LukeShortCloud/winesapOS).
- [Make It Jingle (MIJ)](https://github.com/LukeShortCloud/mij) = This is a side project I started to write in Python. I was hoping to get speed advantages with the PyPy compiler but ran into a huge limitation: most of the libraries I needed are not supported. In comparison, Rust is just inherently faster since it's a compiled language. At this point, I'm also interested in seeing if I can adapt MIJ to run on embedded devices such as the Raspberry Pi Pico I recently got for my birthday.

Will you be taking the challenge to learn Rust next? [Let me know](../../#contact)!
