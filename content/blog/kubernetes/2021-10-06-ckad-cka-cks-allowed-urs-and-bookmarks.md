# CKAD CKA CKS Allowed URLs and Bookmarks

{{< image src="../../images/blog/kubernetes/2021-10-06-ckad-cka-cks-allowed-urs-and-bookmarks.jpg" alt="Colorful bookmarks" set="fit" >}}

A few common questions many people have around the Kubernetes exams (including myself) are what websites are you allowed to access during the exam and how many web browsers or tabs can you have open? As I prepare for my CKS exam this week, I wanted to make sure I knew what resources we have available to us. You can, and will, be kicked out of your exam if you do not follow their strict guidelines.

You can only have two tabs open: (1) with the actual exam and (2) with documentation. No other windows are allowed (web browser or otherwise) which means no split-screen windows. Sorry to all the 4K and/or ultra-wide monitor users out there. Below are the list of documentation websites you can access and bookmark:

CKA and CKAD:

- https://kubernetes.io/docs/
- https://github.com/kubernetes/
- https://kubernetes.io/blog/

CKS:

- (All of the CKA and CKAD links listed above)
- https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/
- https://docs.sysdig.com/
- https://falco.org/docs/
- https://gitlab.com/apparmor/apparmor/-/wikis/Documentation

For setting yourself up for success, organize all of your bookmarks into at least one folder. Sort them by importance. The concepts or references you need the most should be at the top for quick and easy access.

Hopefully these small tips help prepare you for success! Good luck with your exams!
